        Hi! I am Hugo, and I am a software developer from Finland. Most of the
        time I do frontend magic with React and Typescript, but I like
        data-analysis and machine learning too.
        <br />
        <br />I am always open for new challenges, projects and problems and
        feel free to reach out via LinkedIn etc. You can see my projects down
        below, and you can follow me on Github if you find those projects
        interesting!

    </div>
