        As you probably noticed, I like web development and especially
        front-&shy;end develop&shy;ment. I have been working at Visma Consulting
        since 2020, and I have been constantly trying to learn more about web
        development. I am currently finishing my masterâ€™s degree in
        soft&shy;ware engineering at LUT University, and it should be ready next
        winter.
